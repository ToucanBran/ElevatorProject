Elevator Project

Project Summary:

The attached code has the capability to simulate one or multiple elevators as if they were in a real
building.

Inputs:

Under the main.resources package is a JSON file where you can manipulate building and/or elevator properties.

To run:

In order to run the program, an instance of TimeManager will need to be created and it's  method runTime will need to be
called. In order to simulate people, you'll need to pass in an anonymous function that creates Person objects who will
"press" floor buttons at whatever time intervals you want.

To make this easier, I've done this for you under the "tests" package. In the package, I've created three unit tests
based on the tests described in the project outline. You can modify these as you want and just run the unit tests from
there.
